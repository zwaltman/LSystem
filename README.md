# LSystem
L-system generator written in Python. 

Currently all that's finished is the class for L-system objects, including their defining characteristics (variables, rules, starting state, etc.) and methods for iterating them. Currently working on a command line application to interface with this and allow creating and generating L-systems, as well as saving and editing them. 

[This is a personal project I'm working on because I 1) wanted to learn to make a simple command line application and 2) think L-systems are neat and wanted to do something with them.]
