# LSystem
L-system generator written in Python. 

Currently the application consists of two files: LSystem.py and LSystemApp.py. 

LSystem.py contains the class defining L-system objects and giving the means for modifying them and generating their states.

LSystemApp.py is the actual application that allows you to create, save, edit, and generate states of L-systems through the command line.

# Current issues:

1) The entire program works correctly if you know how to use it and always give correct input, but still needs better mechanisms for catching and responding to incorrect input.

2) Adding documentation for everything. Methods, files, etc.

3) Possibly splitting up LSystemApp.py into separate files??
